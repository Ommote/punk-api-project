Welcome to my Punk API project.

In this project, I have utilised my knowledge of React props, state and routing to create a website that displays information about Brewdog beers.

I have loaded the requisite beer information from an open source API.

I enjoyed the opportunity to refine my SCSS/CSS skills. Through this process, I have identified some gaps in my knowledge of SCSS and BEM practices which I hope to address.

I believe that I now have a stronger grasp of some key Javascript methods such as filter and map. This project has also helped me to better understand Javascript, for example when checking the conditions in the if statements (in order to carry out the filtration process) and returning different results.

In hindsight, it would have made better sense to host the content of Main in CardList, and to treat Main as a container for both CardList and Nav. I did try to rectify this at one point but it resulted in a loss of functionality.

Overall, I have definitely increased my understanding of React through completing this project. I think React is a very effective tool for building websites and I look forward to using it in many more projects.
